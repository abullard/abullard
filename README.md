### 💻 Projects
- [Akio](https://github.com/abullard/akio) - A DX tool for NPM Script Discoverability
  - Here's a Production worthy repo I'm proud of–it's deployed, heavily automated, & secure.
- [Gameboy Advanced ROM Study](https://github.com/abullard/gba_study)
  - My favorite personal Project, this taught me loads about embedded development.

### 🧠 How I think
- In right-sized chunks. Define requirements & stick to the plan. Scope creep kills projects
- I plan for long term solutions, I don't want to resolve the same problem in 6 months. _Documentation is vital._
- Code is never just logic. It documents human assumptions, incentives, and failure modes, so design it for how people actually use, misread, and maintain it.
